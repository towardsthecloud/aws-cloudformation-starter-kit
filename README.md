# AWS CloudFormation Starter Kit

Welcome to the AWS CloudFormation Starter Kit, designed to streamline your infrastructure setup using CloudFormation templates and the Rain tool. This repository provides a structured approach to managing your AWS resources as code, ensuring efficient and reliable deployments.

> **Towards the Cloud runs the AWS foundation for modern product teams. This means your team ships faster, slashes AWS spend, and stay audit-ready without having to hire a platform squad.**
>
> Unsure where to start? Book a free AWS Account Review. We‚Äôll analyse your AWS environment, hand you a security & cost report, and you decide whether to act on it yourself or have us execute. No pressure, no retainer required up front.

> Ad‚Äëhoc builds become 40‚Äì60% overspend, unmonitored security gaps put customer data at risk, and engineers burn out running infrastructure instead of shipping products.

> centralized logging, and SSO-ready access control.
> - ‚úÖ **Production-ready CDK components** ‚Äì Pre-hardened building blocks so teams launch new services without reinventing best practices.
> - ‚úÖ **CI/CD with safe rollbacks** ‚Äì GitOps workflows and governed pipelines that let you release faster with confidence.

> - **30%+ lower AWS bill** ‚Äì Continuous oversight prevents expensive drift ([30‚Äì60% documented savings](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization#case-study)).
> - **SOC 2 / HIPAA acceleration** ‚Äì Guardrails, logging, and evidence packs ready on day one.
> - **Audit-ready every quarter** ‚Äì Automated monitoring plus recurring reviews keep findings under control.
> - **Faster product velocity** ‚Äì Engineers build features, not managing infrastructure.
> - **Headcount leverage** ‚Äì A [flexible retainer](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing) replaces the cost of a full-time platform team.

## Features

- ‚ö° **One-Command Setup**: A single bootstrap script automatically generates environment-specific parameter files, configures GitHub Actions workflows, and sets up OIDC authentication‚Äîgetting you production-ready in minutes.
- üîí **Secure Deployments**: Deploy CloudFormation stacks securely via OIDC-authenticated GitHub Actions‚Äîno long-lived AWS credentials needed.
- ü§ñ **Pre-Commit Validation**: Templates are scanned with cfn-lint and Checkov before deployment to catch security issues and AWS best practice violations early.
- üåê **Multi-Environment Support**: Separate parameter files for dev, staging, and production environments with isolated deployment workflows.
- üöÄ **Automated CI/CD**: Push to main and watch your infrastructure deploy automatically with full validation and rollback capabilities.

## Quick Start

This project requires **Python 3** and **pip** for managing dependencies.

**To get started, follow these steps:**

1. Click the green ["Use this template"](https://github.com/new?template_name=aws-cloudformation-starter-kit&template_owner=towardsthecloud) button to create a new repository based on this starter kit.

2. Install checkov, cfn-lint via pip & rain via homebrew:

```bash
brew install rain
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the `provision-repo.sh` script to generate the parameter and workflow files for your environment:

```bash
./scripts/provision-repo.sh
```

4. Validate your CloudFormation templates:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

5. Deploy the oidc-provider CloudFormation stack:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-templates.sh
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure that you have the required IAM role or user setup in your aws config file. Use a tool such as [Granted](https://github.com/common-fate/granted) to make accessing your AWS account via the CLI easier and more secure.

6. Navigate to your repository's settings on GitHub and configure the Actions variables as shown below:

![GitHub Repository Variables](./images/actions-variables.png)

You can now deploy your CloudFormation stacks by committing changes to the main branch.
